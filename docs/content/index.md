# Overview

**Deps (v3) is a command line tool that runs in CI to automate dependency updates.**
It will automatically create branches, commit changes, and send you pull requests.

Because it runs in your existing CI/CD environment,
it leverages the setup you've already done and makes it easy to support vendored dependencies and running your own commands to ensure you get automated updates that truly help your team.

## 1. Try it locally

Installing `deps` on your machine is the easiest way to get started and see how things work.
You don't need an API token to run it locally.

install `deps` to run in your CI provider.
