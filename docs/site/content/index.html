## Locally

An easy way to get started with `deps` is to try it on your own machine!

To install it,
[download a release](https://github.com/dropseed/deps/releases) or use the following install script:
```sh
$ curl https://www.dependencies.io/install.sh | bash -s -- -b $HOME/bin
```

Once `deps` is in your `$PATH`, you can check a local project for dependency updates:
```sh
$ cd MY_GIT_REPO
$ deps run
```

## In CI

When you are comfortable with how deps works,
you'll want to set it up in your CI provider to automate your dependency updates.
Most CI systems have a cron or scheduled job function,
which is how we recommend using it.
This way your regular CI pipeline can run uninterruped by deps during your normal workflows.

Below are some simple examples of how you might configure this,
but you should adjust the setup to work how you want within your existing CI configuration.

You will also need to give deps access to your git repo. The easiest way to do this is usually with personal access tokens.
